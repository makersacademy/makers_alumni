## Summary

Hello guys,

I'm part of February's 2014 cohort. Before that I was an economics student on a gap year in the UK,
around a month after to work for Workshare as a junior ruby developer at £25,000 PA.

## Before MA

I was studying economics in Caracas, Venezuela. Programming was something I was always interested but never quite
had the time to master. Since the country was on a bad state ( politically and economically ) I decided to start a gap
year in the UK and explore the possibility of studying the rest of my major there.

I assessed going for an undergard, but that implied waiting 3 years ( in order to be eligible for finance )
and then investing another 3 in a career. Which IMO was wayyyy too much waiting :goberserk: , so I took the wild bet and decided to for MA
since the career prospectus after completion seemed just as good.

## Getting hired

I'm unfamiliar with your circumstances, but when I was looking for work I needed one ASAP( I was running out of :money_with_wings: )
so I applied for everything that MA pitched at me, after one successful interview I accepted an offer from a company called [Workshare](http://www.workshare.com/)

Around ~3 months after I accepted another offer for a company called [Show My Homework](https://www.showmyhomework.co.uk/) at £32,000 PA since it was:

- A) Less specialised, Workshare was mostly working with Microservices written in Ruby and SMHW , Full-stack Ruby on Rails. IMO Staying in a more general ground the ~1st year of your career is a good thing, keeps thing broad.

- B) More inline with my expectations in terms of salary.

After a year with SMHW, I decided to look for a new job since I wasn't really happy there(new office was far from central london, etc.) and decided to job hunt again, I just now ( nov 2015 ) joined [Zapnito](https://www.zapnito.com/).

Although now that I've shared more or less how the path's being for me(job-wise) here's some advice I wish I knew when I was looking for a job:

#### Interviews happen both ways, ask good/solid questions:

That includes:

- Reason why the last employee left.

- Their expectations on you and your work.

- How willing are they to invest in you? For example Workshare held software architechture classes once a week, which made a massive difference in my career.

These are just a few, but they are *really* worth asking.

#### Recruiters are not the devil, however...

In my experience 80% of recruiters are unprepared and will do any stupid thing to push candidates forward(even to companies that are not hiring). How to tell if a recruiter's good/bad?

- Check their Linkedin profile, good ones usually have some recommendations from a developer they placed at whatever job.

- Attitude over the phone, blacklist anyone that comes across as pushy/annoying.

- Check the companies they're hiring for. Some are not willing to disclose them unless you decide to apply, drop them if they do that.

- Some of them will ask for "exclusivity" when they're trying to get you a job. **Don't accept that** Only do things that enhance your odds to get more interviews.

#### On MA's hiring services

When I did the course this department wasn't as developed as I think is today, so I'm guessing is improved quite a lot.

**The good thing** is that you're pushed forward to the technical interview step, so due dilligence is minimal for you.

**But remember** MA's hiring service is like every other recruitment service ( but better in some aspects ). Which means they only work with their client companies, limiting yourself to them also limits your potential opportunities.

#### Technical interviews.

It's always good to keep yourself sharp by doing [coding challenges](https://www.hackerrank.com/). Knowledge is power here :star: :rocket:

- Ask your employer what the interview will consist of, and study/explore more on that topic.

- They will want to see more problem-solving skills and fast learning rather than code. Take your time and feel free to describe how an implementation would look like and work your way to getting it done.

- They are not rocket science, **confidence plays a big role**, I usually come up with better solutions when I'm focused but not intimidated by the problem at hand.

If you want to dig even deeper into companies and tech interviews, **[Palantir has done an amazing job covering their process](https://www.palantir.com/getting-hired/)** Although bear in mind that's for *software development* positions and not **web development.**

#### Wrapping up.

I'm happy with this career choice, whether I'll come back to finish an undergrad is something that I ask myself every now and then :)
